# Shared Vendors

This folder contains shared libraries which come from external vendors. The code was pulled from the following repos and branches:

- utf8rewind: https://bitbucket.org/knight666/utf8rewind (mercurial repo, not git).

Note that some of these are forks of the original code and might have been modified from the original code in order to ease integration/compilation and might not reflect the current state of their respective origin repos. Changes to these directories must be pushed up to the fork repos as subtree. Changes from the original repos must be merged into the fork repos and then pulled as a subtree.
