# Base
A simple, lightweight &amp; cross-platform base library.

This contains basic Object, String, File, Array, Pointer, etc.. Objects all use the pimpl idiom and cannot be created on the stack. All pointer are shared pointers and no direct calls to new or delete are made.

Basic unit test support using GoogleMock is provided. All classes will have 100% coverage eventually :)

This library is released under the MIT license.
